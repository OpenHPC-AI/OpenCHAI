Concepts
===============

The Concepts section provides a detailed explanation of the core components,
architectural abstractions, and operational models used by OpenCHAI to represent
and manage an HPC–AI cluster.

This section is intended to help users and administrators develop a deeper
technical understanding of how OpenCHAI orchestrates cluster provisioning,
resource management, workload scheduling, and service integration across
heterogeneous environments. It explains how individual services and subsystems
interact to form a cohesive, scalable, and production-ready HPC–AI platform.
