HPC Software Stack
=================

The HPC Software Stack defines the layered software ecosystem required to build,
operate, and optimize High Performance Computing (HPC) and AI-enabled clusters.
This stack integrates operating systems, drivers, middleware, resource management,
programming environments, and user-facing tools into a cohesive and scalable platform.

OpenCHAI automates the deployment, configuration, and lifecycle management of
this complete software stack across heterogeneous cluster environments.
